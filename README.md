# FULL STACK INTERN TASK 1

Deployed Link: [https://arcsys-task.vercel.app/]

The project is built on the Next.js framework.
For styling, I have used the Tailwind and SCSS.

The project has been majorly divided into three sections:
    The Navbar
    The Hero section or The Chats section
    The Footer 

I have tried to prioritize the looks of the interface and did not add any functionality as of now to the navbar or the footer section.

However, for the chats section I have implemented the active state of any chat and also implemented a hover effect on the individual profile.
    The chat section is divided into two sections that are:
        LEFT SECTION, where you could see all the chats and that is where I have implemented the hover and active state functionality.
        RIGHT SECTION, where you could see the individual chats and the history.
        However, I could not implement the history feature due to lack of time.

The assets have been downloaded from the Figma link.

Thats all for the approach and the technologies I used in building this project.

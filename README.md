# FULL STACK INTERN TASK 1

Deployed Link: [https://arcsys-task.vercel.app/]
Github Link: [https://github.com/PratyakshG/ArcSys-task]

The project is built on the Next.js framework.
For styling, I have used the Tailwind and SCSS.

The project has been majorly divided into three sections:
    The Navbar
    The Hero section or The Chats section
    The Footer 

I have tried to prioritize the looks of the interface and did not add any functionality as of now to the navbar or the footer section.

However, for the chats section I have implemented the active state of any chat and also implemented a hover effect on the individual profile.
    The chat section is divided into two sections that are:
        LEFT SECTION, where you could see all the chats and that is where I have implemented the hover and active state functionality.
        RIGHT SECTION, where you could see the individual chats and the history.
        However, I could not implement the history feature due to lack of time.

The assets have been downloaded from the Figma link.

Thats all for the approach and the technologies I used in building this project.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
